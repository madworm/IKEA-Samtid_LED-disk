V0.27.a ctrl-board PCB:
-----------------------

* Solder 100k (0603) across C1 to resolve auto-reset issue running 5V.

  This is fixed in later releases by adding R2.

* Do NOT solder the center pad of the QFN-32 chip.



V0.27.a LED-board PCB:
----------------------

Do not populate DS1 (SK84), the voltage drop is too large.

If you want to use a poly-fuse, use a single 3A one and place it
onto the SMC footprint of DS1. 1812 packages kinda work, a bit
larger would be good. Use thick wire to bridge F1 and F2.
