Total current consumption is 2.75A (100% white, all LEDs on), so a 5V,3A power
supply is sufficient. Much easier to get and smaller than 5A or more.

* Use thick wires. The voltage drop at 2.5A across thin ones is significant.

* Be extremely careful with temperature when soldering! These things die easily!


A word about safety:
--------------------

When run at full brightness in white mode, the circuit board does heat up.
Do not run in this state unattended and keep it away from easily flammable
matter.
