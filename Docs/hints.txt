Electrical connections:
-----------------------

Total current consumption is 2.75A (100% white, all LEDs on), so a 5V,3A power
supply is sufficient. Much easier to get and smaller than 5A or more.

* Use thick wires. The voltage drop at 2.5A across thin ones is significant.


Soldering:
----------

* Be extremely careful with temperature when soldering the WS2812B LEDs.
  They die quite quickly if T is too high and exposure to heat is too long.
  Read the 'reflow' section of the datasheet. I use 240°C tip temperature.
  255°C is too much.

* Try not to apply to much physical pressure when handsoldering. When the pads
  are heated for the solder to melt, the plastic body becomes soft. In this
  state the bonding-wires break very willingly.


A word about safety:
--------------------

When run at full brightness in white mode, the circuit board does heat up.
Do not run in this state unattended and keep it away from easily flammable
matter.
