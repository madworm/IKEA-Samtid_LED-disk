Electrical connections:
-----------------------

Total current consumption is about 3A (100% white, all LEDs on), so a 5V,3A power
supply may be sufficient. If you can get a stronger one, do so.

* Use thick wires. The voltage drop at 2.5A across thin ones is significant.


Issues with WS2812B LEDs:
-------------------------

* Sometimes these things fail ("dead on arrival").

* If you don't get ANY light whatsoever, consider replacing the very
  first LED in the chain (LED1).

* If you have an oscilloscope (or logic analyzer), check the data line
  before and after suspicious LEDs. Sometimes the "sender" is bad (but
  still lights up), sometimes the receiver is bad.


Soldering:
----------

* Be extremely careful with temperature when soldering the WS2812B LEDs.
  They die quite quickly if T is too high and exposure to heat is too long.
  Read the 'reflow' section of the datasheet. I use 240°C tip temperature.
  255°C is too much.

* Try not to apply to much physical pressure when handsoldering. When the pads
  are heated for the solder to melt, the plastic body becomes soft. In this
  state the bonding-wires break very willingly.


A word about safety:
--------------------

When run at full brightness in white mode, the circuit board does heat up.
Do not run in this state unattended and keep it away from easily flammable
matter.
