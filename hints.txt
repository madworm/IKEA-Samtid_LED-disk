The SK84 Schottky diode drops about 0.25-0.4V or so, which may be too much.
Either don't populate (replace with thick solid wire), or get a tunable power
supply and increase the voltage a bit to compensate.

Total current consumption is 2.5A (100% white, all LEDs on), so a 5V,3A power
supply is sufficient. Much easier to get and smaller than 5A or more.
